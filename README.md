The R script provided in this repository was my resolution to this exercise.

## Instructions for the simulation exercise

### Task 1
Randomly place n=10 points within a unit square. 

### Task 2
Find the two points that are closest to each other and compute their distance. Find the two points that are farthest from each other and compute their distance. Code these calculations from scratch; do not use a packaged function.

### Task 3
Repeat (1) to (2) r=50 times. Collect the closest and farthest pairs. Plot all pairs on a scatter plot, with blue points for closest pairs and red points for farthest pairs. Report the average closest- and farthest-pair distances on the scatter plot.

### Task 4
Repeat (1) to (3) for n=20.
